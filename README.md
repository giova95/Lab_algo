# Algorithms Laboratory

### A simple python implementation of two algorithm exercises

#### Linked List VS BST
In this excercise I compared and tested different implementation of order statistic tree, one with ordered Linked List the other with Binary search tree.
To do that I wrote python code, extracted results into tables and graphs (Pandas, Matplotlib), prepared a short report(Latex).

#### Insertion Sort VS Counting sort
In this excercise I compared and tested two classic sorting algorithms: Insertion and Counting.
To do that I developed a python notebook with Google Colab, where inside you can find the implementations of the algorithms, graphs and tables generated by tests.
